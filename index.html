    <h1>MYSELF</h1>
    <h3>A little about myself</h3>
    <p>My name is Dina Anjolaoluwa Afolashade.
        I'm a student of Caleb University in
        the Computer science, statistics and 
        Mathematics undergraduate program. I'm 
        dark-skinned and 5"3. I enjoy cooking,
        baking, reading(mainly novels but blogs
        and articles do too), writing(not too 
        deeply) and math. 
    </p><p>I am very uncomfortable in public
        situations. I cannot dance to save my life,
        despise having pictures of me taken (my 
        roommate calls me a ghost) and I will cry
        if my dodo burns. I do love God, my family,
        hugs, videogames and oh my friends. I am a very chill person
        (wink wink).

    <h1> My Five Year Aspiration</h1>
    <p>In 5 years, I'm going to be getting a 
        Master's degree in either AI, VR, Air 
        Traffic Control or Games Development. I'm 
        undecided on which exactly but I want to be sure 
        I end up studying something I love. 
    </p><p>I do know though, that in 5 years, I will
        have gathered a considerable amount of skill;
        enough to last a lifetime.
    </p>
